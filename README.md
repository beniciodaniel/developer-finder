## Developer Finder (DevsRadar)!
A web and mobile application made with ReactJS, React Native and Node.js in the Omnistack #10.

### Prerequisites ðŸ“‹
To build the  application I needed [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com) but to this project I used [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)) installed on the computer.

To install Yarn I used [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
$node -v = v12.14.1
```
brew install node@12
```
$yarn -v = 1.21.1
```
brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies
```
